# Impac't

A Breakout/Bolo clone, augmented with a physics engine


## TODO

 - display gravity vector as a visual aid for the player
 - nicer visual effect when the racket hits a block
 - nicer visual effect for killing spree bonus
 - special blocks that
   - blur the screen
   - make blocks semi-transparent
   - distort the screen
   - cause a kind of asteroid shower (or other dangerous things that fall from the sky and can severely harm the racket)
   - increase inertia of racket
   - speed up/slow down ball (friction?)
 - place racket on level's default position in case it was caught in between wall segments or something like that
